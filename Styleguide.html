/*
Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming. They typically cover:
    Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions.
    Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments.
    Programming practices and principles
*/
// We use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).
//  firstName = "John";
Spaces Around Operators
Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas:
*/
/*
let x = y + z;
const myArray = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];
*/
// Code Indentation
// Always use 2 spaces for indentation of code blocks:
/*
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}
// Do not use tabs (tabulators) for indentation. Different editors interpret tabs differently.
*/
// STATEMENT RULES
// Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.
/*
const cars = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
}; 
*/   
/*
General rules for complex (compound) statements:
    Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
    Use one space before the opening bracket.
    Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
    Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.
*/
/*
if (time < 20) {
var greeting = "Good day";
} else {
var greeting = "Good evening";
}
*/
/*
// OBJECT RULES
General rules for object definitions:

    -Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name.
    -Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.
    -Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.
    -Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair.
    -Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leaVing spaces.
    -Always end an object definition with a semicolon.
    Example
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
*/
/*
//Naming Conventions
Variable and function names written as camelCase
Global variables written in UPPERCASE (We don't, but it's quite common)
Constants (like PI) written in UPPERCASE
*/
/*
 //Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript names.
